      This directory contains some grid files in netCDF format
      for use in the SCRIP remapping package.

      In addition, there are several source codes for creating
      netCDF files for use in SCRIP:

      CreateLatLon.F90 - creates a simple lat/lon grid for SCRIP

      CreateLatLonX.F90 - CreateLatLon variation, with some command-line arguments.

      convertPOPT.f  - converts input grid files for the POP 
                       ocean model to SCRIP netCDF format

      convertgauss.f - creates a SCRIP netCDF grid file for
                       a Gaussian lat/lon grid that a global
                       spectral model would use

      convert_old.f  - converts old grid files from a previous
                       version of the SCRIP routines

usage of CreateLatLonX

% CreateLatLonX FILENAME LON-SIZE LAT-SIZE [OFFSET-LONGITUDE] [SHIFT-MID-LONGITUDE]

The final optional argument, SHIFT-MID-LONGITUDE, is not for practical application
but for tests.

[caution]
Using SHIFT-MID-LONGITUDE except for zero may cause trouble at remapping.
This value is meaned to be used for sensitivity tests, to check the effect of
error in the reference coordinate, not for general use.  Remapping file contains
the center longitude that is also shifted, thus may influence the other programs
such as scrip_test.  So it is recommened to replace src_grid_center_lon and
dst_grid_center_lon variables by ncks after execution of scrip,  as follows:

% ncks -A -v src_grid_center_lon REFERRENCE.nc REMAP.nc

where REFERRENCE.nc contains the expected central longitude, and REMAP.nc
is the remapping table file to contain shifted central longitudes.
